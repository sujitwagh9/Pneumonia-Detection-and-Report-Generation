# Automated X-ray Image Analysis and Report Generation

This project introduces an innovative solution for automated X-ray image analysis and report generation, leveraging advanced deep learning techniques to enhance diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in radiology. The system is designed to identify and highlight lung abnormalities, with a particular focus on conditions like pneumonia.




## Features

- Automated detection of pneumonia from chest X-ray images.

- Detailed diagnostic reporting using advanced deep learning techniques.

- Grad-CAM visualization for enhanced interpretability.(Working On)

- Integration with Gemini API for detailed medical report generation.

- User-friendly web-based interface for image uploads and report downloads.

## Usage

1) Upload a chest X-ray image through the web application.
2) The system will analyze the image using a trained deep learning model.
3) View the diagnostic report generated by integrating Grad-CAM visualizations and Gemini API.
4) Download the report for future reference.
## Future Scope

- Expand the dataset for improved accuracy.
- Include detection for other chest diseases like tuberculosis etc.
- Real-time deployment in healthcare facilities.
